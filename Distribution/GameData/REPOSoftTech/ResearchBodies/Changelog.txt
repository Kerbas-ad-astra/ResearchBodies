V1.8.1 (07-30-2016) ==
Improved integration with Contract Configurator Mod.
V1.8.0 (07-10-2016) ==
*Re-factored so much of the code... Under the hood now uses Scenarios to automatically save and load the game state to the persistent.sfs file.
*If you have an old researchbodies.cfg file in your save folder V1.8.0 will read it and convert it into the new format,save your game into the persistent.sfs file and
delete the old savegame file (researchbodies.cfg).
*Moved Mod Folder from \GameData\ResearchBodies to \GameData\REPOSoftTech\ResearchBodies. Please ensure you remove any \GameData\ResearchBodies folders from your install.
*The database file and locales files remain as the default settings for new games.
*Fixed a whole bunch of little bugs along the way (both real and potential).
*Re-factored how the Discovery mechanism works. So no more clicking forever, but still some randomness. There was a potential bug that meant the more
you clicked and didn't find anything the less likely you would on following clicks, which only reset when you changed game scene.
*Science reward for finding a body with the telescope is now the base science reward (that you get in the Observatory) PLUS the science reward that is
set in the config file for each telescope part.
*Some more screen messages, eg: When you don't actually have enough EC to scan for bodies (previously you got no indication that was the problem).
*Fixed the Part Menu - messages now display correctly for when you discover and don't discovery bodies. Also added a list of the already
discovered bodies to the Menu so you can see what bodies have been discovered and it will update when you do discovery new bodies in flight.
*The ResearchBodies part action button (right click menu) is now disabled (not visible) if ResearchBodies is not enabled in current save file. eg: sandbox game and config has enableinsandbox = false.
*Ignored/Auto-discovered Bodies (based on difficulty setting at start of new game) also display these automatically in the Observatory menu.
*If you enter the SOI of a previously un-discovered Body or a Body that has not been fully researched it will now be automatically discovered and
it's Research Program will be fully completed. Might look to change this in a future version to auto-discover but depending on the vessel type
(Probe or manned/kerballed) set the research percentage to a more appropriate amount and perhaps require the vessel to remain in SOI to
increase the research percentage over time. (But that's for a FUTURE version).
*Input (keyboard) Control locks are set on for new games until you select your new game settings. (can't use menus, flight, etc).
*Compatible with Asteroid Day for KSP 1.1.3 update.
*NOW the BIG one:- Progressive CelestialBody visibility is now included. Yes the celestial bodies will start with very low detail in flight and
in the tracking station. As you find them and research them, the details become clearer. This is still very basic functionality. Plan to expand this
greatly to include other mod integration like SCANsat scanning to provide the final levels of details.

V1.7.2 (01-06-2016) ==
*Changed Contract cancellation (when a contract is generated for a body not yet discovered) to Withdraw instead of Cancel. 
This will not penalise reputation.
*Fixed bug where above code was causing issues when cancelling contracts making the Mission Control building inaccessible.
*Ignore Bodies with Radius < 100m (Sigma/Binaries in Kopernicus)and handles barycenter/orbits of sigma binaries.
*Added support for Blizzy Toolbar (can switch between Stock AppLauncher Icon and Toolbar in the Settings Menu - However, it does not save this setting between game sessions - next version).
*Re-factor and clean-up of the code started.
*If Kopernicus is installed changes the range of the telescope to 540 million kilometers. (standard is 100 million kilometers).
*Added ability to do Tooltips to the GUI windows (Have only added a few for now, more to come).
*Changed the in-flight Telescope - ResearchBodies window to indicate the EC usage each time you press the Search button.
*Added a message to the in-flight window to indicate if there are bodies within the angle of the telescope but are to far away for the telescope to detect them.
*Fixed issues with Kopernicus installed and actually discovering celestial bodies.
*Moved cache data into /ResearchBodies/Plugins/PluginData to avoid resetting Module Manager cache load on startup when these files change.

V1.7.1 (05-10-2016) ==
*Fixed errors with V1.7 using deprecated RenderingManager calls causing Part to break KSP.
*Added KSP-AVC version checking.

v1.7 (05-04-2016) ==

*ModuleManager is now version 2.6.24

v1.6 (01-27-2016) ==

v1.4 (08-26-2015) ==
*New telescope model made by forum user Well
*Complete overhaul of the tracking process :

  *when the research state is 100% you can launch vessels to it
*Added Wernher von Kerman portrait to space center UI
*Added Locale system
